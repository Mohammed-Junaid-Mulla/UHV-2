What is Natural Acceptance?

Natural Acceptance is something we have within ourselves naturally. It helps us in exploring ourselves and understanding who we truly are. We can check this for each and every proposal and verify whether we truly feel a particular way or we are feeling something because of our preconditioning and societal standards. This helps us in achieve clarity about our feelings and line of thought. It is important that we pass everything through our natural acceptance before we take action. As only the things that are naturally acceptable to us can keep us happy in the process of doing them. If we do something against our natural acceptance we will eventually end up and regretting it and feeling sad. Thus it is important that we take natural acceptance into consideration at every step in life.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why it is?

Natural Acceptance is naturally embedded in us. It is very important as it helps us become more human. It is gives us clarity in life. It helps us understand what we want, and work towards achieving it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to achieve it?

Natural acceptance provides us an answer when we put forth a question to ourselves. It is important to properly understand this feeling and remember it to be able to use it. Thus to achieve natural acceptance we have to look within ourselves and find out how we truly feel. Thus it is important to consciously give thought to our emotions and way of thinking and finally discover that which is naturally acceptable to us.
