----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is meant by prosperity and accumulation?

Prosperity: There are two basic aspirations of every human being: continuous happiness and prosperity. Prosperity is related to material things or what we call as ‘physical facilities’. We need physical things to take care of our body and these need to be catered to. When we are able to cater to the needs of the body adequately, we feel prosperous. Prosperity is a feeling of having more than required. Prosperity is a feeling of having more than required physical facilities; it is not just physical facilities.
Accumulation: The gathering much more physical facilities and wealth than required is called accumulation. However, accumulation does not directly lead to prosperity. Prosperity is the feeling of having accumulated enough. Thus accumulation without right understanding will lead to constant feeling of deprivation with no feeling of prosperity.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why is it important?

No matter how much wealth we accumulate we will always feel deprived, if we don’t have the right understanding. Hence it is important to have the right understanding. It is only when we have the right understanding that we can feel prosperous.
Thus it is important to able to properly differentiate between prosperity and accumulation and not confuse them with each other.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How can we achieve it?

We can achieve prosperity by working hard to accumulate enough physical facilities and by being satisfied with what we have accumulated. It is important to achieve this right understanding. This can be done by stopping comparing with others in terms of wealth which will keep making us feel deprived and actually focus on ‘what’ and ‘how much’ makes us happy.
